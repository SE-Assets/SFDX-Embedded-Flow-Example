# Embedded Flow - SFDX Side

This repo contains a practical example of a working embedded flow, which can be integrated into any non-Salesforce external website and allow visitors of a website or app to interact with Salesforce without logging into it or otherwise accessing it.

This particular feature has a number of super useful applications, and it's a lesser-known aspect of the digital engagement and Service Cloud side of our Customer 360 Platform

## SFDX Instructions

If you're familiar with SFDX, you'll have everything you need herein to provision a scratch org with the feature enabled. You'll then need to use the paired lightweight Node.js app (deployed to Heroku, of course) to act as your mock external website.

## Test Org
I've got a developer org that I use to demo this. The username is `fcaron+embedtest@salesforce.com`.
